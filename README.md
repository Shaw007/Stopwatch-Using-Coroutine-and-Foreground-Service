# Stopwatch-Using-Coroutine-and-Foreground-Service

This is Stopwatch app that I developed in my spare time. This app lets user start a stopwatch with pause and resume functions. User can aslo close the app but the app will continue to run the stopwatch in the foregound notification. Foreground notification also has the functionality to pause and resume the stopwatch.


This app user Android Jetpack Libraries. Some of them are:

- Navigation Component
- ViewModel and LiveData
- ViewBinding
